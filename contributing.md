# Contributing to Fuz

Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Fuz,
a [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) UI library.
The project is currently in early alpha,
and there will be many breaking changes ahead.

I'm an independent dev making this library to support [my other projects](http://www.ryanatkn.com/)
that focus on end-users. Like every UI library, Fuz can't satisfy everyone's needs,
and it has opinions and design choices that make it more specialized than most UI libraries.

Fuz does want to be broadly useful, and I always appreciate help making it the best it can be.

Please [open issues](https://github.com/ryanatkn/fuz/issues) with any bugs, proposals,
or other things you would like to discuss.

## Developers

If you feel comfortable looking at the source code,
Fuz is ready to use in your own projects,
with the major caveat that there will be a lot of breaking changes.
The code is significantly incomplete but I think it's stable enough to use
if you're willing to keep up with a sometimes-incomplete [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).
(reading PRs may be needed sometimes, I'll work on that)
See the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/ryanatkn/fuz/issues).

I'm open to PRs when they fit the project's design goals, which can be subtle and arbitrary.
Feel free to open PRs for straightforward changes,
but for most PRs please start with an issue or Discord discussion.

The code is permissively licensed, feel free to fork for your own needs.

## Funding
