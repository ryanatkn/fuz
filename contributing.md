# Contributing to Fuz

Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Fuz,
a [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) UI library.
The project is currently in early alpha,
and there will be many breaking changes ahead.

I'm an independent dev making this library to
support [my other projects](https://www.ryanatkn.com/)
that focus on end-users. Like every UI library, Fuz can't satisfy everyone's needs,
and it has opinions and design choices that make it more specialized than most UI libraries.
But Fuz should be broadly useful, and I always appreciate help
making it more generic and flexible when it doesn't compromise other qualities.

Please [open issues](https://github.com/ryanatkn/fuz/issues) with any bugs, unhandled usecases, proposals,
or other things you would like to discuss.

## Developers

I'm open to PRs when they fit the project's design goals, which can be subtle and arbitrary.
Feel free to open PRs for straightforward changes,
but for most PRs please start with an issue or Discord discussion.

The code is permissively licensed, feel free to fork for your own needs.

## Funding
